## Overview
In this task, I worked with an e-commerce dataset to perform end-to-end analysis.  
The goal was to clean and preprocess the data, explore customer behaviour, and generate actionable insights to support business decisions.  
Finally, the results were presented in an executive-style report.

## Steps
1. **Data preparation**  
   - Imported the Brazilian e-commerce dataset into Python.  
   - Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring consistent formats.  
   - Merged sales, product, and customer tables to create a unified dataset.  

2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analysed sales trends across time (monthly/seasonal performance).  
   - Looked at customer demographics and purchasing behaviour.  
   - Identified top-performing products and categories.  

3. **Customer segmentation**  
   - Applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to group customers.  
   - Segmented them into categories such as loyal customers, at-risk customers, and new customers.  

4. **Visualisations**  
   - Plotted revenue trends and seasonal changes.  
   - Created customer distribution charts for each RFM group.  
   - Highlighted top-selling products and categories in bar charts.  

5. **Executive summary preparation**  
   - Condensed the findings into a professional report.  
   - Focused on insights that support decision-making, such as retention strategies and product promotions.  

## Outcome
The analysis produced clear insights into sales performance, product trends, and customer behaviour.  
The executive report highlights opportunities for growth, customer retention, and revenue optimisation.  
These findings can guide strategic decisions for marketing and business planning.
